This repo has been created as minimal reproduction for [DEV_SSR disabling / or causing the auto refresh on websites while in Gatsby develop to become disabled. #36554](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/36554)

for those trying to reproduce simply run `gatsby develop` without enabling the <strong> DEV_SSR</strong> flag in `gatsby-config.js` and then again after enabling it and it will stop the auto-refresh.
